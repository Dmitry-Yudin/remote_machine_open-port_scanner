# remote_machine_open-port_scanner

Python 3 script that will scan all open ports on a remote computer:

This script will scan all ports from start_port to end_port on the target machine specified by host. It will print out the port number for any port that is open.

Keep in mind that this script will only scan the ports on the remote machine specified by host. If you want to scan the ports on a different machine, you will need to replace remote_host with the IP address or hostname of the target machine.
